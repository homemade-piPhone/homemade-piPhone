# Step-by-step process used to set up Copilot instructions
steps:
  - step: 1
    title: "Analyze repository structure"
    description: "Examined the repository to understand its purpose, structure, and technology stack"
    actions:
      - "Reviewed README.md to understand project goals"
      - "Examined .gitignore to identify expected code types (Python-focused)"
      - "Explored docs/ folder to understand GitHub Pages setup"
      - "Reviewed issue templates to understand contribution workflow"
    findings:
      - "Project is for building a DIY landline phone with Raspberry Pi"
      - "Uses 3D printing for hardware components"
      - "Documentation hosted via GitHub Pages"
      - "Python expected as primary programming language"
      - "Target audience: makers and hobbyists"

  - step: 2
    title: "Create copilot-instructions.md file"
    description: "Created comprehensive instructions file in .github directory"
    location: ".github/copilot-instructions.md"
    content_sections:
      - section: "Repository Overview"
        purpose: "Provide high-level context about the project"

      - section: "Repository Structure"
        purpose: "Document directory organization and file purposes"
      - section: "Technology Stack"
        purpose: "List hardware and software technologies used"
      - section: "Coding Standards and Best Practices"
        purpose: "Define standards for Python, HTML/CSS, and documentation"
        subsections:
          - "General Guidelines"
          - "Python Code"
          - "HTML/CSS/JavaScript"
          - "Documentation"
      - section: "File Patterns"
        purpose: "Describe expected file types and their purposes"
      - section: "Testing Guidelines"
        purpose: "Provide guidance for testing hardware-dependent code"
      - section: "Contribution Workflow"
        purpose: "Explain how contributors can join and participate"
      - section: "Website Management"
        purpose: "Document GitHub Pages deployment process"
      - section: "Important Considerations"
        purpose: "Highlight key aspects of the project"
        subsections:
          - "Hardware Context"
          - "User Experience"
          - "Open Source Community"
      - section: "When Making Changes"
        purpose: "Provide checklist for contributors making changes"
      - section: "Questions to Consider"
        purpose: "Help contributors think through their changes"
      - section: "Additional Resources"
        purpose: "Link to relevant project resources"

  - step: 3
    title: "Review and validate"
    description: "Verified the instructions file was created correctly"
    validation:
      - "Confirmed file exists at .github/copilot-instructions.md"
      - "Verified file contains 151 lines of comprehensive guidance"
      - "Checked formatting and structure"
      - "Ensured all relevant project aspects are covered"

  - step: 4
    title: "Commit and push changes"
    description: "Added the file to version control"
    git_actions:
      - "git add .github/copilot-instructions.md"
      - "git commit with descriptive message"
      - "git push to remote branch"
