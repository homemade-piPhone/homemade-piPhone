# Website for homemade piPhone project

## How does the project website work?

Website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

Code from the `main` branch, folder `docs` is compiled and served on https://homemade-piphone.github.io.

GitHub Pages settings can be updated [here](https://github.com/homemade-piPhone/homemade-piPhone/settings/pages).

Pages builds and deployments can be monitored in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/homemade-piPhone/homemade-piPhone/actions).

For more details on this Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), see [GitHub Actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## How do I update the project website?

To update the project website, modify the files in the `docs` folder.

We suggest using [GitHub codespace](https://github.com/homemade-piPhone/homemade-piPhone/codespaces) to edit the files.
